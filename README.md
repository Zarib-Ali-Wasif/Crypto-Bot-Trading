## üí° How It Works

### 1. **Strategy Execution**

The bot runs using a predefined trading strategy such as moving average crossovers, RSI, or other technical indicators. It analyzes real-time market data and makes decisions based on your chosen strategy.

### 2. **Risk Management**

To minimize risks, the bot implements stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. You can define your risk tolerance by adjusting these settings.

### 3. **Trade Execution**

Once the bot identifies a trade opportunity, it places orders on your chosen exchange (e.g., buy/sell BTC). The execution is fast, ensuring you don't miss out on profitable opportunities.
